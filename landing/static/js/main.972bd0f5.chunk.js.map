Such informal negotiations commence upon Company’s receipt of Notice from you. <br />\r\n            <b>b)\tMandatory Binding Arbitration.</b> If you are not able to satisfactorily resolve a Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, or if Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that it will not be possible to satisfactorily resolve that Dispute informally within a total of thirty (30) days, you agree that either you or Company may request resolution by final and fully binding arbitration conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The party requesting that a Dispute be resolved by arbitration under this Section shall be responsible for initiating such a proceeding.<br />\r\n            i)\tThe American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will run the arbitration between you and Company, and AAA’s rules and procedures (including their Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable) will be used. If something in these Terms is different than AAA’s rules and procedures, then we will follow these Terms instead.

You and Company both agree that neither shall attempt to have any other arbitration or class action related to any other party joined to any arbitration in which you are involved with Company. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no arbitration proceeding shall be decided on a class-action basis or utilizing class action procedures. You and Company further agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.<br />\r\n          </p>\r\n          <h3>\r\n            <b>13.
